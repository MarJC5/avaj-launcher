# avaj-launcher - Java project at 42

## Description

This project is a simple Java program that simulates an air traffic control tower. The program reads a scenario file and simulates the behavior of the aircrafts in the scenario. The program will output the status of the aircrafts as they move around the simulation.

## General instructions

- You are allowed to use language features up to the latest Java LTS version.
- You are not allowed to use any external libraries, build tools or code generators.
- Do not use the default package.
- Create your own relevant packages following the Java package naming conventions.
- Java is compiled into an intermediate language. This will generate some .class files.
  - Do not commit them on your repository!
- Make sure you have javac and java available as commands in your terminal.
- Compile the project running the commands bellow in the root of your project folder.

## Program behaviour

Your program will take one and only one argument from the command line. This argument represents the name of a text file that will contain the scenario that needs to be simulated. You can find an example file provided with the subject. Executing the program will generate a file simulation.txt that describes the outcome of the simulation.
